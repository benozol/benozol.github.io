</header><p>
In BioCreative V, one of the challenge tasks is the automatic extraction of CDRs from
biomedical literature. The CDR task comprises two subtasks. The first sub-task involves
automatic disease named entity recognition and normalization (DNER) from a set of Medline
documents, and can be considered as a first step in CDR extraction. The second subtask
consists of extracting chemical-induced diseases (CID) and delivering the chemical-disease
pairs per document.
</p>

<p>
For the DNER subtask, we used our concept recognition tool Peregrine, in combination with
several optimization steps. For the CID subtask, we applied the optimized Peregrine system
for disease concept recognition; for chemical concept recognition, we used tmChem, a
chemical concept recognizer that was provided by the challenge organizers. A relation
extraction module was trained on a rich feature set, including features derived from a
graph database containing prior knowledge about chemicals and diseases, and linguistic and
statistical features derived from the training corpus documents.
