Post-marketing management and decision-making about vaccines builds upon the
timely detection of vaccine safety signals and changes in public sentiment,
established evidence about a vaccine, and the quantification of benefits and
risks and the verification of hypotheses about the benefits and risks (BR) of
vaccines in observational studies. Prompt and accurate access to such
vaccine-related information is fundamental to ensure the safety of vaccination
programmes and to maintain public confidence. Several resources provide relevant
insights about vaccines but the representation of information differs between
and within resources, which impedes information extraction. This thesis proposed
automatic methods to retrieve vaccine-related information from resources in view
of such representational heterogeneity.
</p>

<p>
\Cref{part:socmed} was motivated by the question if public social media messages capture
information that is relevant for the post-marketing management of vaccines.
\Cref{chap:socmed1} explored the use of social media messages to monitor vaccine safety
concerns by analysing English messages mentioning an HPV vaccine and infertility, a
supposed adverse event. Publicly available data from the considered social media networks
were sparse and largely untrackable for the purpose of providing early clues of safety
concerns. \Cref{chap:socmed2} targeted the monitoring of public sentiment towards a
vaccine in a multinational debate by analysing international, multilingual messages about
a pentavalent vaccine, which had previously been introduced in numberous lower and
middle-income countries. The messages that were analysed in both studies possessed three
salient properties: frequent references to other websites (particularly news pages), few
interactions between users (i.e., few replies or reposts), and virtual absence of personal
reports about the vaccines. This may, however, come as little surprise given that only
public messages were analysed, whereas personal experiences may rather be expressed in
private messages, which were unavailable for the purpose of the studies.
</p>

<p>
The debate as manifested in social media was portrayed by peaks of messages following
events in country-specific vaccination programmes. The perception of events was local:
users reacted largely to events in their own country or adjacent countries, suggesting
multiple, national debates rather than a multinational debate. The messages did not
directly reflect the public's sentiment about the vaccine issues or events, because most
messages by private persons were composed only by references to news pages that covered
major events in the implementation of vaccination programmes. The messages, however, may
reflect the users' sentiment indirectly exactly because the lack of additional, personal
content suggests that the authors generally concur with the referenced content. The
dominant concern in referred websites was about the safety of the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
\Cref{part:scilit} proposed automatic methods underlying the extraction of established
evidence about vaccines from scientific literature. \Cref{chap:vacco2} focused on the
recognition of vaccine descriptions and on the classification of research articles by
vaccines. The proposed method for the recognition of vaccine descriptions used the VaccO
ontology of vaccine descriptions to recognize vaccines and their properties, and a simple
heuristic to annotate vaccine descriptions based on the co-occurrence of vaccines and
properties within sentences. The method performed reasonably well (F-score 0.69) in
comparison to the inter-annotator agreement of the manually created reference corpus of
vaccine descriptions (F-score 0.80). The error analysis revealed two possible ways for
improving the approach. First, the VaccO ontology should be expanded with non-European
vaccines, vaccines under development, and their properties. Second, the rule-based
heuristic to annotate descriptions based on sentence co-occurrence was a major error
source and should take into account the textual context of recognized vaccines and
properties. The reference corpus of vaccine descriptions that we developed is the first of
its kind and publicly available for training and testing of future methods.
</p>

<p>
For the classification of vaccine articles, we compared dictionary-based, ontology-based,
statistical, and hybrid methods to assign vaccine codes from the MeSH vocabulary by an
analysis of the article title and abstract. A simple dictionary of vaccine descriptions
lacked the necessary flexibility in light of the large syntactic variation of vaccine
descriptions in scientific literature (F-score 0.45). The ontology-based method derived a
list of properties of the articles from the vacco ontology and applied the alignment
algorithm (\cref{chap:vacco1}) for the assignment of relevant MeSH vaccine codes. The
algorithm, which proved suitable for aligning descriptors between vaccine coding systems,
had only moderate performance for categorizing vaccine literature (F-score 0.60). The
better performance of a hybrid random forest model based on the property list derived from
VaccO appeared a more robust approach for assigning vaccine headings (F-score 0.68). A
\gls{cnn} constituted the best model for categorizing vaccine literature but required
substantial training material to train classifiers that perform well (F-score 0.76). The
performance of the \gls{cnn} with respect to a single code correlated strongly with the
number of articles with that code in the training set. The \gls{cnn} performed better than
the ontology-based method for almost all frequent vaccine codes but was outperformed by it
for most infrequent codes. Vaccine codes, however, may necessarily be infrequent in the
training data for novel or less-studied vaccines. To further improve performance, the
neural network-based method and the ontology-based methods could be combined dependening
on the number of training examples.
</p>

<p>
\Cref{chap:religator} covered the extraction of causal relations between chemicals and
diseases rather than vaccines, but this work would support equally well vaccine-related
extractions. The extraction system, RELigator, was implemented by a support vector
machine, using feature sets based on a linguistic analysis of the article, information
extracted from the Euretos knowledge graph, and statistics about words in the training
set. RELigator achieved an F-score of 0.60, and each of the features sets contributed to
the final system performance.

\Cref{part:ehr} presented methods to retrieve vaccines and outcomes from \gls{ehr}
databases that use different coding systems. In \cref{chap:comap}, we presented
CodeMapper, a web application that assists in the mapping of clinical case definitions
into code sets from multiple coding systems, which is often a bottleneck in the
implementation of collaborative observational studies. CodeMapper constitutes a single
entry point for all phases of creating database-specific code sets for a medical outcome:
the identification of relevant medical concepts from the case definition, the manual
revision of medical concepts, and the projection to database-specific code sets. A number
of semantic operations in CodeMapper help in retrieving related medical concepts during
the manual revision. The overall mapping process is automatically recorded and manual
descriptions of the process are regularly requested, which makes the mapping process
traceable and the mappings more suitable to subsequent studies. CodeMapper and its source
code are publicly available. We evaluated the effectiveness of CodeMapper's approach by
simulating an informed usage. Creating a mapping without revising the concepts was
insufficient for reproducing the reference code sets, indicating that the mapping process
cannot be replaced by a simple indexing step. However, the goal of CodeMapper is to
support an informed user in creating such mappings, and our evaluation showed that
CodeMapper's semantic operations provided an effective and efficient way (sensitivity 0.95
and precision 0.62).

\Cref{chap:vacco1} presented the VaccO ontology of vaccine descriptions, and evaluated
different automatic methods for the alignment of corresponding vaccine codes between
coding systems. The VaccO ontology defines classes for vaccine products and vaccine
properties, namely immunization targets (including pathogens and diseases), immunization
strategies, administration routes, valences, and ingredients. VaccO is agnostic of any
specific vaccine coding systems: the basic class of vaccines does not subsume any codes
but only classes that represent pharmacological vaccine groups, common vaccine
abbreviations (e.g., `DTaP') and vaccine products, which are defined by their relations to
other entities in the ontology. Each class includes a list of terms, which can be used to
identify references to the class in free text. The VaccO ontology is publicly available.
</p>

<p>
The automatic methods for the alignment of corresponding vaccine codes between different
coding systems were based on multilingual code descriptors, the only information about
codes that is available in all vaccine coding systems. Two baseline methods were defined
based on the overlap of words in the descriptors, and on the overlap of \gls{umls}
concepts identified in the descriptors. The baseline methods were compared with three
methods built on the VaccO ontology, defined by the overlap of VaccO classes recognized in
the descriptors, the equivalence between the logical expressions that represent the
descriptors in VaccO, and the overlap between properties inferred about the descriptors
from the ontology. The baseline methods lacked domain-specific knowledge about vaccines
and vaccine descriptions, and were generally outperformed by the methods built on the
VaccO ontology. The method based on the overlap of recognized VaccO classes outperformed
the baseline methods in the reference set with multilingual descriptors, due to the
multilingual dictionary in the VaccO ontology. The method based on the equivalence of
logical expressions correctly aligned codes of equivalent vaccine groups described by
different properties (e.g., `HPV vaccine' and `cervical cancer vaccine'). The method based
on a flat representation of inferred information additionally identified matching codes
across taxonomic levels, and demonstrated excellent performance (F-scores 0.91 and 0.96 in
two reference sets).
</p>

<p>
Accurate, automatic methods for extracting information from resources with
representational heterogeneity for the post-licensure vaccine management can be based on
task-specific rules, formalized domain-knowledge, or example solutions using supervised
machine learning. Formalized domain-knowledge provides the highest flexibility for
specific vaccine-related tasks, where training corpora are unavailable.
