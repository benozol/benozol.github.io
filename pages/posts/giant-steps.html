This post presents how proof failures in program verification can be explained
using what we call, giant-step runtime assertion checking. This is collaborative
work with Claudio Belo Laurenco and Claude Marché and has been published as

What is actually a proof failure? The aim in <i>deductive program verification</i> is
to prove that a program satisfies some formal specification. Here we look into
<a href="https://why3.lri.fr">Why3</a>, a platform for deductive program verification. The standard language of
Why3 is WhyML, where specifications are just part of the program, as in the
following example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-why3">use int.Int

let main1 (x: int)
= let y = x + 1 in
  assert { y &lt;&gt; 43 } $\prooffailure$

let f (x: int) : int
  ensures { result &gt; x }
= x + 1

let main2 (x: int)
= let y = f x in
  assert { y = x + 1 } $\prooffailure$
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So we try to prove that the program is safe, that the annotations are valid for
any input. When the proof fails, when we cannot prove it, we want in Why3 to
help the programmer and explain why it has failed. There are two categories of
proof failures:
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, a proof failure can arise when the program does not conform to
the annotation, which fails for some program input. For example, if you call
function <code>main1</code> with 42 as argument, the assertion fails. We call this a
non-conformance between program and annotations.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, an annotation may be actually valid during execution, but
still it's impossible to prove it because some sub-contract in the context is
too weak, in this case the post-condition of function <code>f</code>. We call this a
sub-contract weakness.
</p>

<p>
And in case of a proof failure in Why3 one can request a counterexample, that is
a value binding for program variables that invalidate a verification goal.
</p>

<p>
In Why3, half of the pipeline to generate counterexample is actually shared with
the pipeline for program verification: Starting with the annotated program, the
verification conditions are generated, and using some transformations, one or
more verification goals are created. The preconditions and the negated goal are
printed as SMT input. If the SMT solver finds that the SMT input is
unsatisfiable, the verification goal is valid. Otherwise, solver models are
requested, from which a counterexample in the original program is derived, a
process that has been described by Sylvain Dailler and others.
</p>

<p>
I call these counterexample <i>candidate</i>, because first, SMT provers don't give any
guarantee on the validity of their models, potentially resulting in bad
counterexample, that violate preconditions or don't invalidate the verification
goal. And second, the SMT solvers don't have a notion of the underlying program,
and thus cannot give any hints on the reason of the proof failure.
</p>

<p>
The objective of this work is to check the validity of candidate
counterexamples, and to categorise proof failures using normal and giant-step
RAC.
</p>

<p>
This is actually very much inspired by the work of Guillaume Petiot and others,
where proof failures in FRAMA-C, so in C programs, are categorised by test
generation.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, I will present the standard runtime assertion checking as
implemented in Why3, the giant-step runtime assertion checking, and how both are
used to accomplish our objective.
</p>

<p>
First a few words on normal RAC in Why3. RAC is just normal program execution,
where annotations are checked as they are encountered during runtime, with
respect to the current execution environment. Invalid assertions terminate the
execution, if it is an assertion we say the execution fails, if it is an
assumption, we say the execution gets stuck.
</p>

<p>
Why3's annotation language is not executable, so deciding the validity of
annotations can be pretty difficult. In Why3, three steps are tried to decide
the validity of an annotation. First, a term reduction engine is used to compute
the validity of the task. If this doesn't work, the task is, seconds, send to a
prover. Since the reduction engine is bad at using preconditions with quantified
variables, and SMT solvers are bad at identifying invalid terms, we, third, we
try to prove the task with negated goal using a prover, and invert the result.
If nothing works, and the decidability of the task is incomplete, the execution
may or may not terminate.
</p>

<p>
Normal RAC can be applied to a counterexample: You first find the program
function from where the verification goal originates, in this case function
main1. And then, you initialise the program parameters with the values from the
counterexample, in this case you apply `main1` to 42, which results in a failure
for the verification goal.
</p>

<p>
As an intermediate result we can state that a
failure during normal RAC pinpoints an non-conformance between the program and
the failing assertion.
</p>

<p>
But how to we identify a sub-contract weakness?
</p>

<p>
A sub-contract weakness is actually an invalid assertion from the point-of-view
of program verification, which is modular: this means that from the outside,
functions and loops are not defined by their bodies but by their post-conditions
and invariants - the sub-contracts. Also, counterexample values for function
calls and loops comply to the sub-contracts, usually!, and are not derived from
the function bodies and loop bodies.
</p>

<p>
The idea of giant-step RAC is now: it is just like normal RAC but function
bodies are not executed in calls, and loop bodies are not iterated. Instead,
return values and values of written variables are read from an oracle.
</p>

bodies are not executed in calls, and loop bodies are not iterated. Instead,
return values and values of written variables are read from an oracle.
</p>

<p>
What does this mean? Here is the normal RAC for a call to function f with
arguments v1 to vn. The function definition is annotated with the variables that
may be written in the function body, a precondition and a postcondition. For
RAC, the argument are first bound to the parameters in the environment, and then
the the preconditions are asserted, the execution fails when they are invalid.
Then, the body is evaluated to a return value v, and the written variables may
be modified by side-effect. Then the postconditions are asserted and the value v
is returned.
</p>

<p>
Giant-step RAC execution is equipped with an oracle, and instead of executing
the function body, it makes a giant-step: it just retrieves the result value v
and the values of the written variables from the oracle. The post-conditions are
now assumed, and the execution gets stuck if they are invalid.
</p>

<p>
And the giant-step RAC of a while loop starts as normal by asserting the
invariant initialisation. But then, it does a giant-step to the beginning of
some loop iteration by updating the written variables by their values from the
oracle. The values from the oracle are assumed to fulfil the invariant. The
execution continues almost normally: If the loop condition is false we're done,
and if the condition is true, the loop body is executed, and we assert the loop
invariant preservation. But if everything went well, we get stuck, because the
oracle provides only values for a single loop iteration.
</p>

<p>
So how can we use this to identify sub-contract weakness? We first find again
the program function from where the proof failure originates, here function
main2. And we execute that function twice, using normal RAC and giant-step RAC,
each may terminate normally, fail, get stuck, or be incomplete, for example in
case of annotations that couldn't be decided. For each execution, the program
parameters are taken from the counterexample, so here we apply main2 to 0. The
normal RAC terminates normally. For the giant-step RAC, the result for the call
to f is 2, as given from the counterexample, and the execution fails. And this
is exactly the criterion to identify a sub-contract weakness!
</p>

<p>
Here is overview on how to check counterexample and categorise proof failures,
with the result of the normal RAC in the rows, and the results of the giant-step
RAC in the columns. A mentioned earlier, a failure during normal RAC indicates a
non-conformance between program and annotations. A failure only during
giant-step RAC fails indicates a sub-contract weakness. If both executions
terminate normally, the counterexample is bad, because it didn't trigger any
failures. If the giant-step RAC gets stuck, then the counterexample is bad
because its values didn't comply with the sub-contracts where they were used.
</p>

<p>
To wrap up, here is one example, adapted from the experiments conducted by
Petiot et al. in FRAMA-C. The function isqrt computes the square root of an
integer using three variables and a while loop. The post-condition states that
the argument n is be between the square of the result and the square of the
result plus one. Why3 proves the VC without further ado.
</p>

<p>
But what happens if there is actually an error in the implementation, for
example if we mistakenly use a subtraction instead of an addition in line 18?
Why3 will report a proof failure for the preservation of the loop invariant in
line 12, say that the program doesn't comply to that annotation, and give a
trace of the execution from the normal RAC: the main function was called with
argument 4, the variables were initialised, the loop is iterated once, and in
the end the loop invariant preservation fails.
</p>

<p>
And if weaken the sub-constracts of the loop, by replacing the invariant in line
13 by true? Why3 will report a proof failure for the post-condition, and specfiy
that some sub-contract is underspecified, together with an execution trace from
the giant-step RAC: that the main function was called with the argument 1, the
variables were initialised with values from the oracle (that correspond to the
normal RAC). For the loop, a giant-step is executed with assigning 0 to r and y,
and 1 to z, which fulfils the invariants. The condition becomes false, the loop
terminates, and 0 is returned as a result, for which the post-condition fails.
</p>

<p>
As you just witnessed, sub-contract weakness is a property of the whole program,
and we are planning to identify single sub-contract weaknesses, to be able to
point to specific functions or loops. We are working on an integration with
Ada/SPARK, which uses Why3 behind the scenes, and further effort is needed to
deal during giant-step RAC with oracles that don't provide all necessary values.
